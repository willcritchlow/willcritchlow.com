I'm founder and CEO at [SearchPilot](https://www.searchpilot.com), making SEO testing faster, easier, and more accurate for large websites.

Prior to running SearchPilot, I founded the SEO agency Distilled in 2005 along with [Duncan Morris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncanmorris/). We started the SearchLove conference series in 2009, expanded both the SEO consulting business and the conference series to the US, and ended up with offices in Seattle and New York, and running conferences in San Diego, New York, and London.

We built a platform for SEO A/B testing and agile changes to large websites which we spun out as an independent business called SearchPilot in February 2020 at the same time as the remainder of the Distilled business (along with SearchLove) was acquired by Brainlabs.

My views may not be those of all (or any!) of the organisations I am associated with.
